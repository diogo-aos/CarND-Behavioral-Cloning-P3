If model predictions are poor on both the training and validation set (for example, mean squared error is high on both), then this is evidence of underfitting. Possible solutions could be to

increase the number of epochs
add more convolutions to the network.
When the model predicts well on the training set but poorly on the validation set (for example, low mean squared error for training set, high mean squared error for validation set), this is evidence of overfitting. If the model is overfitting, a few ideas could be to

use dropout or pooling layers
use fewer convolution or fewer fully connected layers
collect more data or further augment the data set
